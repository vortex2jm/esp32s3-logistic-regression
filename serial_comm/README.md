## Serial Communication

 - This script is responsible for sending feature vectors to the ESP32-S3 via the serial port. It simulates accelerometer data acquisition using a sliding window approach, processing the data before transmission. The vectors are sent at 500ms intervals, mimicking a real-time data stream with a 500ms gap between consecutive readings.

 - The test_features.csv file is generated by the preprocessing pipeline of the machine learning model.
